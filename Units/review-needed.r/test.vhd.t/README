This one is inherited from e-ctags source tree.

The input looks too large. Therefore it is hard to evaluate the impact
of code change; a small improvement on the parser needs huge updates
of expected.tags.

The test case is kept as is. However, if you will work on improving
VHDL parser, you may rearrange this test input as you need.
